üëã Hi, my name is

# Sergei Parfenov

<img src="#" alt="Black and white portrait on a colored background." width="">

I'm an engineer with a passion for education and technology. I love finding ways to use technology to enhance the learning experience and make a positive impact. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my two dogs and exploring all that Serbia has to offer.

You can find information about my experience on my personal [page](http://p0rt.github.io/resume/). Currently, I work as a product technical manager at Practicum USA, where I help to develop educational technology.
